This generator creates a Dockerfile and scripts (`dockerTask.sh` and `dockerTask.ps1`) that helps you build and run your project inside of a Docker container. The following project types are currently supported:
- .NET Core
- Node.js
- Go

## Installing

Prerequisites:
- [Node.js][nodejsSite]
- [Yo generator][yoSite]

Install the Docker generator:
```bash
npm install -g generator-docker
```

## Getting Started
Once yo docker and VS Code are installed, here's the few steps to debug your first app
### Node.js
- From the root of your project, where your server.js file exists, open a bash or powershell window
```bash
yo docker
```
- Answer the prompts, including your image name
- Open the file you wish to debug and set a breakpoint
- From VS Code, open the command palette (Mac: **[âŒ˜]** + **[P]**, Windows: **[CTRL]** + **[P]**)
- Enter: `task composeForDebug` This will compose your containers using the dockerTask.sh script
- **[F5]** to start the node debugger within the container
- As we use `nodemon -L --debug-brk`, the debugger will break on the first line of your main file, so that you can debug the initialization of your app

### DotNet Core
- From the root of your project open a bash or powershell window
```bash
yo docker
```
- Answer the prompts, including your image name
- Open the file you wish to debug and set a breakpoint
- **[F5]** to start the .NET Core debugger within the container

## Q&A
- **Q: Are you building an abstraction layer over docker apis?**
  - **A:** No. These are your scripts. We're simply providing a starting point that docker developers would write themselves. These scripts are based on customers we've been working with.
- **Q: Are you taking feedback?**
  - **A:** Of course. Please open an issue at [yodockerissues] or choose to [contribute][contributingLink].
